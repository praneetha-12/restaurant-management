A classical approach to simplify food orders. 

ABSTRACT

Restaurant management is the process of overseeing the day-to-day operations of a restaurant or similar establishment. It includes a wide range of jobs and responsibilities, such as managing corporate finances and promoting business growth, as well as marketing, staff management, and providing excellent customer service. A restaurant manager's role is essentially to balance the numerous needs of the business, to give leadership, to create strategic objectives, to use restaurant management software, and to guarantee that all departments are running properly. Restaurant management is ultimately concerned with steering a restaurant to long-term prosperity. A restaurant management system is a type of software built specifically for use in the restaurant business. Such systems, often known as restaurant management software, are designed to aid leaders and others in doing the most vital managerial activities. This type of system could be a full all-in-one solution that combines parts of a POS system, such as payment processing, with more complex back-end functions, such as personnel administration, inventory management, and a booking or reservations system. Some restaurant management systems, on the other hand, concentrate on specific areas.


CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

1.1 Introduction to the topic

A restaurant management software, at the basic level, is a system that includes all of the operational, and marketing components you’ll need to run your business. It handles payment processing, order management, and day-to-day reconciliation and streamlines operations and marketing. In the restaurant industry, the value of integrated restaurant management software solutions is sometimes ignored. They are sometimes viewed as little more than a mobile cashier. However, restaurant management software solutions are capable of much more. Modern restaurant software systems combine the functions of a computer with a cash register, allowing them to accept credit card payments, print receipts, show information on a user-friendly screen, and act as a service station.

1.2 Software

There are 6 types of softwares restaurants typically use:
❖ Point-of-sale (POS) systems:
With restaurant management software, restaurant owners can track each and every transaction through the system which further helps them to reduce the risk of fraud in the restaurant. The POS system provides an authorization process on every level of management, making it thoroughly secure.

❖ Accounting software:
Entering financial data manually is a hectic affair. Not only does it take a lot of time, but it also increases the risk of human error. A person will probably enter some figures twice or omit others without knowing. Restaurant accounting software eliminates the possibility of such redundancies, ensuring data entered is correct and accurate. This gives the owner more confidence in the financial reports generated. It also gives them the ability to troubleshoot any potential problem.

❖ Loyalty programs:
There is the perception that customers get something back from the restaurant when they participate in these programs, and they do. They get coupons, information, news, and promotions that those who do not participate in the program may never see. While the real benefactor is the restaurant, because of the increased sales, the customer also feels that they benefit from giving their information and time to a restaurant that they enjoy.

❖ Online ordering platforms:
An online ordering and delivery system provides a complete sales channel for the restaurant. This means that the restaurant can use it as a tool for generating more profits and organizing the restaurant better. It also allows restaurant owners to save on labor costs and restaurant space needed to serve such customers. When properly implemented, the system can help a restaurant bypass its competition by getting closer to the customers.

❖ Third-party delivery apps:
When the third-party services or apps are used, the restaurant becomes discoverable amongst new customers within that area. Increased profits is one of the profound advantages.

❖ Scheduling software:
The system must ensure that none of the employees are overworked, or are facing any issues while working. The owner should also be aware of their employees' availability, their upcoming work schedules, and leave balances if any. The software should be able to automatically track such data, and analyze employee availability.

1.3 Uses

The Restaurant Management System helps the restaurant manager to manage the restaurant more effectively and efficiently by computerizing meal ordering, billing and
inventory control.


CHAPTER 2
PROPOSED SYSTEM

The current system is paper based. Papers are used in restaurants for displaying the traditional menu cards, writing down the orders of customers, storing the records of customers. The disadvantages of paper based system are that papers can get easily damaged by stain marks; they can be lost due to fire or accidents or can get lost in general. Hence, time and money is wasted. As traditional menu cards are paper based, any changes that need to be made in the menu will require reprinting of the entire menu card, leading to wastage. For small changes, reprinting the entire menu card is impossible. Changes in the menu card cannot be made dynamically. It is inefficient to access a particular record from the stack of papers. This system is time consuming. One has to call a waiter a number of times till he notices it, and wait for him to arrive at their table to take their order. Also the waiter can misinterpret the customer’s order since he is writing the order on paper, and the case of serving a wrong dish is possible. A Tablet menu completely revolutionizes the patron’s dining experience. Existing programs provide an app that restaurants can use to feed their menus into iOS & Android based tablets and make it easier for the diners to flip, swipe & tap through the menu. We aim to provide an advanced menu display using a console at restaurants with a tablet menu that would let the customers order their food with ease. Developers of similar applications maintain that customers who sit at tables outfitted with tablets spend about 10% more than those at other tables (“people buy more when they can do so instantly, without waiting for service”). Our program has the following features:
❖ The first feature focuses on the bulk purchase by the restaurant owner.
❖ The second feature involves a control panel where a customer can choose what
they want to order out of the digital menu displayed on the screen or the
console.
❖ The third feature displays the bill/the receipt after the final order.
